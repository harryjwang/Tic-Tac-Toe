# Tic-Tac-Toe

Harry Wang - 1A ECE at University of Waterloo

Created a 9 squared tic tac toe board with each board having a game going. Within the game, there are several options for the users to pick
between: user vs user, user vs AI, or AI vs AI. We were able to set up the AI by using the randomizers so that the computer would randomly
place X's and O's in random places on the board.

This tic tac toe game was created as a fun new way for my friends and I to play tic tac toe without having to continually draw out the 9 squares
for the game every time we wanted to play. So, this coded out game made it a lot easier to play a tic tac toe game whenever we wanted to.
